    <h3>My favourite book is The Psychology of Money</h3>
    <p>Simmel believed people created value by making objects, then separating themselves from those objects and then trying to overcome that distance.
        He found that objects that were too close were not considered valuable and objects that were too far away for people to obtain were also not considered valuable. 
        What was also considered in determining value was the scarcity, time, sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting objects. In the pre-modern era, beginning with bartering, different systems of exchange for goods and services allowed for the existence of incomparable systems of value (land, food, honor, love, etc.). 
        With the advent of a universal currency as an   intermediary, these systems became reconcilable, as everything tended to become expressible in a single quantifiable metric: its monetary cost.
